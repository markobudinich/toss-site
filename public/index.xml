      <description>We are happy to remind you that the Tara Oceans Seminar Series (TOSS) will kick off this Tuesday. This first Seminar will feature a retrospective talk by Eric Karsenti and a senior talk by Olivier Jaillon. We will circulate the link for the virtual seminar shortly.
As the information regarding the seminar series has to circulate among coordinators, associates and their group members, we have set up a mailing list to facilitate such communication (and hopefully reduce the number of emails that need to be forwarded within labs).</description>
